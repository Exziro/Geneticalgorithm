\section{Background:}

	The optimal path problem is a very classical mathematical problem, which is the basis for many optimization problems such a s resource allocation, path analysis and design. The shortest path algorithm can be divided into a single vertex shortest path algorithm, and a shortest path algorithm between each pair of vertices. A typical solution to converntional route planning problems is the Dijkstra algorithm, which has used in road networks and in dynamic environments to find a route minimizing the travel time from an origin to a destination. However in the practical application, the size of the shortest path problem is expanding, the constraint condition of the shortest path problem is increasing. In the traditional algorithm, it is difficult to effectively find a perfect solution to quickly find the optimal solution or suboptimal solution. This paper will give a genetic algorithm try to solve the problem.

%\paragraph

1.As a kind of intelligent search algorithm, the optimization process of genetic algorithms do not have much mathematical requirements. The genetic algorithm is modeled according to the specific problem, and the solution is found by evolution without having to consider the specific internal operation problem.

\subsection{Genetic algorithm}
%\subparagraph
Genetic algorithm is a computational model simulating the natural selection and genetic mechanism of Darwinian biological evolution, and it is a method to search the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution. Genetic algorithm starts from a population which represents the potential solution set of the problem, and a population is composed of a certain number of individuals encoded by gene. The steps of the Genetic algorithm are firstly generation some population. After the generation of the first generation of population, according to the survival of the fittest and the survival of the fittest, generation evolves generation by generation to produce better and better approximate solutions. In each generation, individuals are selected according to the fitness of individuals in the problem domain, and with the help of nature. Genetic operators in genetics carry out cross and mutation to produce populations representing new solution sets. This process will result in the population of the posterity, like the natural evolution, more adaptable to the environment than that of the previous generation. The optimal individuals in the last generation can be decoded as the approximate optimal solution of the problem. Genetic algorithm generates many solutions to a single problem each one with different performance some are better than other in performance. So it have been successfully applied to many search, optimization, and machine learning problems. The evolutionary process consists of maintaining a population of coded solutions which are manipulated by variation operators to find a satisfactory optimized solution. Such as find path, the writer used GA to help the robot path planning\cite{Alnasser2016}, and then they find the GA is more efficiency and effectiveness. 

\subsection{Dijkstra algorithm}
%\subparagraph
A type solution to conventional route planning problems is the Dijkstra algorithm(DA), which has been used in road networks and in dynamic environments to find a route minimizing the travel time from an origin to a destination. The main feature of Dijkstra algorithm is to extend from the starting point to the end. In the past ten years, more and more people use the algorithmt to make life better, they use the algorithm in the every aspect of life, such as cargo navigation, mine rescue shortest path. With the time go on, people try to use DA to solve some dynamic problem\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-60042-0_15}. However there also have some trouble in the DA, such as the most cost. To imporved the time cost, reseacher use Folyed-warshall algorithm and GA to find the best rout for the emergency patient\cite{Risald2017}. 

\subsection{The pruning algorithm}
%\subparagraph
In the optimization of search algorithm, pruning is to avoid some unnecessary traversal through some judgment. Generally speaking, it is to prune some "branches" in the search tree, so it is called pruning. The core problem of applying pruning optimization is to design pruning judgment method, that is, to determine which branches should be abandoned and which should be retained. The pruning algorithm often used in some machine learning algorithm\cite{Hu2019}, which achives the high-quality uncertainty estimation with a small value. In the other hand, the pruning stratages used in some tree problems and some search path problem.\cite{10.1007/978-3-642-28493-9_10}, which writer used the tree-delection pruning in the real-world road networks.
%\subparagraph
Many studies using genetic algorithm to solve multi-objective route planning problems have been reported, which include a review of recent issue and applications to mobile robots, personal navigation, tourist sight sight-seeing itinerary and personal navigation. In the recently, one research using GAs to solve the supermarket manger traveling problem\cite{Al-hayali2018}.This is one of the shortest path problem,the writer makes a GAs models and then use an example to show the GAs is an efficient method to provide optimizations of these problems. Another article\cite{Kanoh2008} improved GAs to solve the multi-objective route planning problems in dynamic problems, and then he compared with traditional GAs and Dijkstra algorithm, the improved GAs cost a less time than before, in the other hands, the JunWoo\cite{Kim2019} kim studies the candidate order based genetic algorithm to solve the maze-type shortest path problem, and then the author compared Fitness Switching Genetic Algorithm and Candidate Order based Genetic Algorithm. 

\section{Research plan:}
%\subparagraph
Implementation Genetic algorithm, which following step is in the figure1

\subsection{Coding and decoding}
%\subparagraph
Coding the all of the graph point. Randomly generate sequences to form the original chromosome as the initial population, the length is the total number of points in the graph. Then use the depth traversal algorithm to get the decoding shortest path based on the node id.
\subsection{Set the fitness function:}
%\subparagraph
The fitness function is an important section in the genetic algorithm. From the table 1, the fitness function needs to calculate the individual fitness value, and then judgment the direction of evolution. Use fitness function can choose the best individual and then choses the generate direction. From the recently study\cite{Gunturu2017}, the reasercher use the fitness function to find game equilibria, the result proposed  fitness function increase the efficiency of Genetic Algorithms. 
\subsection{Crossover operator }
%\subparagraph
Crossover operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. It is a one way to stochastically generate new solutions from an existing population. this is one of important process in the Genetic algorithm. However in the article\cite{Osaba2013}, the reasercher gives a converse opinion, the crossover function do not give any improvement to the process of optimizing of a genetic algorthm, even though the crossover function may cost more computing space. In this paper, we will compare the computing time about the two process.

\subsection{Mutation operator.}
%\subparagraph
The mutation operator is an auxiliary method, and it has an effect on the local search ability of genetic algorithm. Mutation operator can change the individual chromosome to make a new chromosome, it can help the algorithm get some new solution and then avoid the local optimum.
\subsection{Add Pruning algorithm}
%\subparagraph
Traditional genetic algorithm has some question, like high computational cost, especially to get the optimal solution cost. So this paper uses the pruning algorithm to reduce the cost. To improve the genetic algorithm, this paper will use the pruning algorithm to cut the size of the graph, reduce the size of the graph and cut the more offspring.
\subsection{compare with the Dijkustra algorithm}
%\subparagraph
To proposed the improved Genetic algorithm's advantage, this research will compared the Dijkustra algorithm and the improved Genetic algorithm.

\section{Research purposes:}
%\subparagraph
Traditional genetic algorithm to find the shortest path more quickly than the Dijkstra algorithm, however the genetic algorithm has more computation cost than the Dijkstra algorithm\cite{Osaba2013}. This paper will use the pruning algorithm to improve the traditional genetic algorithm and compared with the Dijkustra.
